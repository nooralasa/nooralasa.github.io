											<br/>
											<p>
												Machine Learning models relay on large volumes of training data to achieve Artificial Intelligence. 
												Self-driving cars, being the primary example of the technology, relay on trillions of photographs of street signs and driving scenarios to achieve autonomy. 
												No contextual data produced from Middle Eastern cities is available for the expansion of such futuristic technologies into the Middle East.

											<br />
											<p>
												Users can submit a stanza of poetry and its recitation. 
												We then translate the stanza through the Google Translate API and add the submission to an ongoing, endless flow of poetry.
												The running recitation can also be experienced in a VR simulation.

												RevolVR was my team's submission to the <a target="_blank" href="https://realityvirtuallyhack.com">Reality, Virtually Hackathon</a> in 2016. 
												RevolVR was a finalist and won <a target="_blank" href="http://pastevents.realityvirtuallyhack.com/winners-2016">the Best Entertainment Award</a>.
											</p>
											<br />
											<p>
												RevolVR is a virtual reality game that showcases a locomotion mechanic for Vive in which the player can run in place to traverse the
												virtual space. In this game, the player is running in place within a revolving wheel, while trying to collect gems and
												shoot off falling meteors. All of this is happening while the entire space is collapsing into the center of an anomaly
												in the middle of the wheel.

												Syria Intellimap was my team's final project for the Advanced Natural Language Processing class at MIT.
												We generated a map of Syria's conflict using information extracted from activist and journalist tweets.  
											</p>
											<br />
											<p>
												We mined the tweets of 60 Twitter users over 5 years of conflict, extracting 3200 tweets. 
												We then annotated a subset of these tweets to train our NLP models. 
												We used an event classifier to classify the war events discussed in the tweet and Named Entity Recognition (NER) to extract locations and factions. 
												We then used that extracted data to generate a visual map with these events.

												Through the workshop, I led a team of bright and motivated young leaders in the Middle East through the Design Thinking process.
												We explored Virtual Reality technologies and visited the Zaatari Refugee Camp in Jordan to better understand learning challenges that young refugees faced.
												The team created Sphyria at the culmination of the workshop.
											</p>
											<br />
											<p>
												Sphyria is a VR application that can be viewed with a smartphone using Google cardboard. It showcases a map of Syria on
												top of which the user stands. On that map are multiple 360 photospheres. The user can click on any of these photospheres
												and be able to view a 360 picture from Syria in 3D. Within that photosphere the user can hear recordings of memories
												that other Syrians in the diaspora have recorded for that place as well as record their own.

												During my time at the Media Lab Learning Initiative, my PI, Philipp Schmidt and I developed a year-long capacity building
												program intended for empowering innovators in the Middle East to build learning solutions for the refugee crisis. The program
												consisted of an online learning portion, an in-person workshop, and a seed funding stage for the most successful start ups.
											</p>
											<br />
											<p>
												In 2016, I built LIME to support the online learning and community building stage.
												In 2017, the Learning Initiative launched the <a target="_blank" href="https://refugeelearning.media.mit.edu/cohortone.html">Refugee Learning Accelerator</a> based on this initial work.
											</p>
											<br />
											<p>
												Learning Innovators Middle East is a platform for online learning and community building.
												Built with a React/Reducx/Node/PostgreSQL stack and integrations with gitlab, gitter, and online courses from udacity and edX, 
												LIME supported a project-based and community-focused approach to digital learning.

												In April of 2020, I organized and hosted a Virtual IDEAthon with the MIT Arab SciTech Team, with the theme of ‘Learn From Home: Rethinking Learning During the COVID19 Crisis’. 
												Over the course of the half-day event, participants identified problem areas, ideated on them and presented their initial concepts to a jury.
												Over 250 participants from 25 countries attended the virtual event, and a total of 42 teams pitched ideas.
												We supported the top 10 finalists with mentorship and access to organizations that could provide funding.
											</p> 
											<br/>
											<p>
												During the first half of the event, we ran the attendees through the Design Thinking Process through three workshops: Problem Definition, Brainstorming, and Prototyping.
												The event was streamed live and the workshops can be watched online.
											</p>
											<br/>
											<p>
												<a target="_blank" href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/5-stages-in-the-design-thinking-process">The Interaction Design Foundation</a> 
												defines Design Thinking as a design methodology that provides a solution-based approach to solving problems. 
												It’s extremely useful in tackling complex problems that are ill-defined or unknown, by understanding the human needs involved, by re-framing the problem 
												in human-centric ways, by creating many ideas in brainstorming sessions, and by adopting a hands-on approach in prototyping and testing.

												In January of 2018, I helped run a week-long workshop for learning innovators in Amman, Jordan, as part of the <a target="_blank" href="https://refugeelearning.media.mit.edu/cohortone.html">Refugee Learning Accelerator</a>.
												During the event, I ran an interactive workshop on pitching. 
											</p> 
											<br/>
											<p>
												The first portion of the workshop focused on Delivery, highlighting the use of gestures, speech and presence. 
												The second portion discussed Persuasion and how to make a persuasive pitch.
												The third focused on Content, including the Hook, By-Statement, Problem and Solution, ending with a Storyboarding exercise.

												Through countless interviews and interview preparation for technical positions at companies like Google and Amazon, I've gained a lot of practical experience on technical interviewing.
												I have first-hand experience with interviewing for Software Engineering, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.productplan.com/what-is-product-management/">Produce Management</a> 
												and <a target="_blank" href="http://developer-evangelism.com/">Developer Evangelist</a> positions, but the skills I've gained are relevant for many technical positions.
											</p> 
											<br/>
											<p>
												Depending on the position that you're applying for and your timeline, there are specific things that you could be doing to prepare 6 months, 2 weeks, or 2 days before the interview.
												Start with creating a solid resume and working on your online presence. Contact recruiters on LinkedIn and ask your network for referrals. 
												Most technical positions will have two types of interviews: behavioral interviews and technical interviews. There are concrete steps that you can take to prepare for both.

								After finishing my undergrad at MIT in 2016, I started a Masters of Engineering at the MIT Media Lab.
								Joining the Learning Initiative under the supervision of <a target="_blank"

								we started thinking about refugee learning in the Middle East, focusing on locally sourced solutions.

							<h2>King's Academy</h2>
							<p>
								In 2008, I was one of a few SEP students in my cohort to get accepted into King's Academy and receive
								full
								Financial Aid.
								Ninth grade was the hardest year for me, as I struggled to adjust to a rigorous curriculum in English.
								Math
								was my favorite
								subject since it came naturally to me and did not have as much of a language barrier. King's Academy was
								also challenging
								socially. Coming from a modest upbringing, this was the first time for me to interact with others from a
								different social strata.
							</p>
							<p>
								Today, I look fondly on my time at King's: smart and motivated students, caring and invested teachers,
								beautiful campus and visionary leadership.
								I grew exponentially and took advantage of every opportunity the school exposed me to. I traveled
								outside of
								Jordan and Palestine for the first time in my life,
								attending Round Square conferences in Kenya, India and Thailand. I learned to play an instrument, ran a
								half
								marathon, lead the debate team, learned to code,
								won the declamations competition, and expanded my academic horizons. I started a community service
								initiative, taking three cohorts of King's students
								to visit my village in Palestine.
							</p>
							<p>
								On March 14, 2011, I got accepted into the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, starting a new chapter

							<h2>SEP</h2>
							<p>
								In the fall of 2006, the principle at my public school in Sahab asked me to come to his office.
								He gave me an application that was sent to public schools around the Kingdom, for the
								<a target="_blank" href="https://www.kingsacademy.edu.jo/summer/summer-enrichment-program-sep">Summer

								at King's Academy. King's Academy was at the time being built as the first New England Style Boarding

								in the region.
								It would open to its first class of students a year later in 2007.
								SEP was designed as an outreach program to serve under-privileged students in Jordan.
							</p>
							<p>
								For three summers, from 2006 until 2008, I would spend three weeks boarding at King's Academy. Living
								with
								volunteers
								from Jordan and the States, we focused on improving our English and engaged in a variety of
								extra-curricular
								activities.
								In those formative years, I started to learn English and was excited about the hopeful prospects that
								King's

							<h2>Moved to Sahab</h2>
							<p>
								After my father returned from the UAE, we moved to <a target="_blank"

								Using his savings from working in the UAE and a generous loan from relatives, my father purchased land
								in
								Sahab and constructed a house for the family.
								My parents spent the next two decades of their lives repaying that loan. Coming from a family of
								teachers,
								education was key in our upward movement
								in society. We slowly saw our fortunes improve over the years as we entered the Jordanian middle class.
							</p>
							<p>
								Unlike Zarqa, where a large Palestinian refugee population lived, Sahab was a rising city with a Bedouin
								Jordanian
								population that settled there in the mid 19th century. Growing up in Sahab, I realized that my
								Palestinian
								identity
								was in conflict with my Jordanian one, and slowly learned to be proud of both identities and have them
								co-exist.
								I went to public schools in Sahab and was always at the top of my class. I lead the morning broadcasting

                <button class="collapsible">Oracle - Senior Software Engineer</button>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>
                        During my 3+ years as a Software Developer at Oracle, I have participated in the design, development, and
                        maintenance of industry-grade software. Working on Oracle Commerce Cloud (OCC), I spent the first eight months of my
                        career learning iOS development and contributing to the Assisted Selling Application. I later transitioned to
                        working on a redesign of OCC's main product line: the Storefront.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Large retailers and telecom companies use Oracle Commerce Cloud to build and customize their e-commerce sites.
                        Customers purchase OCC to access an out-of-the-box, hosted commerce site and contract third-party implementation
                        partners who use OCC's headless commerce API, development tooling, and sample UI widgets to customize the
                        Storefront. In addition to the hosted storefront and the commerce sdk, customers get access to an Admin platform
                        (for managing catalogs, site settings, etc), an Agent platform for supporting customer service and call centers, and
                        the Assisted Selling App to manage commerce flows in-store.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During my first eight months at Oracle, I learned iOS development with Swift and XCode, and worked on adding
                        features to ASA, including tax treatment and store credit implementations. At the beginning of 2017, my team
                        transitioned its focus from working on the iOS application to a global initiative of rearchitecting our main product
                        line: the Oracle Cloud Commerce Storefront. It began with a prototype from a team in Belfast for a framework using
                        React and Server-Side Rendering with the OCC APIs, and with that was born the Open Storefront Framework (OSF).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Open Storefront Framework (OSF) has three goals in mind: improving performance, improving SEO (Search Engine
                        Optimization), and improving the third-party implementation partner's development process. My team in Cambridge
                        became in charge of Marcus' (our persona for the implementation partner) development experience and integrating OSF with the
                        existing architecture.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To improve Marcus' development experience, we relied on yarn workspaces and created a command line interface to
                        interact with the OCC endpoints, sync assets, and push Marcus' developed application to our servers. In addition, we
                        had to design a new architecture for installing and serving Marcus' application in the Oracle Cloud.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In its existing architecture, OCC ran in two Java Virtual Machines, one serving the OCC Admin API and its UI and
                        another serving OCC Storefront (both API and UI). Adding React and Server-Side Rendering required adding a
                        Presentation node.js Server to the existing architecture that talked to the Storefront API and got its site settings
                        from Admin. A coworker and I designed and fully implemented a dockerized application that we call the deployment
                        controller.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The deployment controller manages the lifecycle of a deployed node.js OCC application. It exposes a REST API to talk
                        to OCC Admin, receives Marcus' customized OCC applications, and builds and runs them in a green/blue deployment
                        model to ensure continual availability. In a nutshell, I've designed and built the system to run the new OSF
                        Storefront in the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). The system that I've designed and built is currently running in
                        OCI and serving customer storefronts. Through deploying the controller to OCI, I learned about Docker, Kubernetes,
                        and other cloud technologies.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During those two years of developing the deployment controller and the logging solution for OSF, I grew accustomed
                        to in-depth collaboration with a small team of four developers in Cambridge, as well as being the liaison for a
                        global team distributed across three cities. I travelled to Belfast and Hyderabad to present our work in Cambridge
                        and further that collaboration.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Given my natural affinity for presenting and public speaking, I became the go-to developer on the team to demo OSF
                        internally and externally, including demoing the application in an early access session to implementation partners
                        of OCC. I also worked with Oracle University and internal consultants on creating training for OCC developers. My
                        work was recognized when I was promoted to Senior Software Engineer during my first two years at Oracle, an uncommon
                        promotion at Oracle.

                    <p>
                        I worked at Vistaprint, summer of 2016, in Waltham Massachusetts. I joined the Product Design and Technology team and worked 
                        on a tool for country managers to add, remove, and edit dates on holiday calendars. 
                    </p>

                        Project Description: Calendars generate substantial revenue for Vistaprint, particularly during the holiday season.
                        While customers may customize and create calendar dates from Studio, all wall and desk calendars include a predetermined set 
                        of dates and date display behaviors. These are unique to each locale--week start, weekday names, and holidays all require accurate localization and translation review. 
                        The process for setting calendar date requirements has been prone to error; calendar dates are revisited and reviewed many times, by multiple stakeholders, annually. 
                        PDT developers are currently responsible for creating, modifying, and maintaining this data—which is inefficient for both developers and country managers. 
                        The goal of this project is to develop a full-stack web application by which regional experts may add, remove, and update calendar metadata.
                        Our intention is to fully remodel the management workflow to eliminate developer involvement while also providing a guided and responsive self-service experience to our stakeholders.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Over the summer, I developed a standalone web service to help country managers track holiday dates.
                        I designed a database schema, a RESTful web API, and a User Interface, and implemented them with postgreSQL/express/node.js/React stack.
                        The service was deployed on AWS. While building the service, I practiced Design Thinking while working with relevant stakeholders from 
                        Country Managers, PDT Engineers, Product Owners and Localization Engineers. I also participated in agile development with daily stand-ups and using Kanban.

                        I worked with the Hotels team, formerly in charge of Hotel Finder, a product that was being integrated directly into Google Search.
                        Motivated by the popularity of the pricing graphs in Google Flights, I was tasked with investigating the introduction of a similar feature for hotels.

                        The feature is now live on Google search, when searching for a hotel.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Through this unique experience, I learned what Product Management was, how to create a product that's valuable, feasible, usable, and viable.
                        As a Product Manager, you're responsible for the product direction, but have little agency over building it. Thus the role is about persuasion, consensus-building,
                        and doing whatever is possible to make the product successful. It involves working with customers, drafting requirements and working with internal stakeholders to 
                        assure customer satisfaction. I also learned about Google as an organization, it's innovative culture, and engineer focus.

                        I interned at the IRC in the summer of 2013 in Amman. I reviewed and edited reports on women's rights, eco-tourism, and education in Jordan, 
                        translated Arabic reports into English, and drafted proposals for future research.

						<strong>Abstract:</strong> The Syrian refugee crisis has created serious challenges to higher education in regional host countries. 
						While digital educational technologies from the West have the potential of mending some of these challenges, there is a lack of locally appropriate solutions. 
						We see this as a reflection of the modest number of innovators who have the technical and pedagogical training for developing such technologies, 
						with combined understanding of the refugee and regional context. We attempt to bridge this gap by developing LIME (Learning Innovators - Middle East), 
						an online platform for a capacity building program in Jordan and Lebanon. LIME is a Progressive Web Application that was developed with a React/Redux/Node/PostgreSQL stack. 
						Through LIME, learners can take online classes, gain valuable development skills and engage in a community of innovators, all the while working on projects to deal with the refugee crisis. 
						We believe that our project-based, community-focused approach to digital learning can help learners in host countries gain the necessary skills to develop local solutions to refugee education. 
						We hope that such an approach will also alleviate the stress on regional institutions of higher education. We embrace the challenge of refugee education as an opportunity to spur innovation in the Middle East.

						<strong>Abstract:</strong> We seek to facilitate the authoring of handwritten educational video lectures and combine the
						advantages of vector graphics and video editing. Handwritten videos are currently recorded
						using video screen capture, which makes editing challenging. We believe that the power of
						digital content creation is in nonsequential
						iterative refinement. Teachers should be able to start
						a video lecture without a perfect script, and they should be able to improve their material over
						the year. To achieve this, we are working on developing Pentimento , an authoring software that
						dramatically facilitates the authoring and editing of handwritten video lectures. This project deals
						with the JavaScript version of Pentimento , to make it possible to create such videos in the
						browser and across multiple platforms.

						<strong>Abstract:</strong> Conflict zones are notorious for biased reporting under the monopoly of the controlling group 
						and it is hard to get up-to-date and unbiased on the ground news. Social media platforms like Twitter 
						utilize crowd sourced information from local people to provide updates in conflict zones. In this project, 
						we apply NLP techniques to automate the process categorizing tweets regarding the Syrian conflict into discrete 
						events that summarize the conflict over time. In particular, we extract faction, location and event type information 
						from each tweet and summarize it on a time evolving map of Syria.

						<strong>Abstract:</strong> Previous research has shown how Bayesian models
						can be used to show how toddlers simultaneously
						infer property extension and sampling processes
						from small amounts of data (Gweon, Tenenbaum, &
						Schulz, 2009). In this project, we present a Church
						implementation of the model proposed in (Gweon,
						Tenenbaum, & Schulz, 2009). We then extend the
						experiments done in the paper to (1) examine how
						introducing an intent may aect how adult learners
						infer property extension and (2) explore how priors
						on the properties may aect how adults infer the
						property extension.
						Consistent with the predictions of the model, two
						behavioral experiments suggest that adults can rst
						infer the sampling process by observing the exper-
						imenter's intent, then use this information to infer
						the property extension.
